For this assignment you will be creating a simple Tapestry application that uses Cayenne as its persistence layer. For this assignment you will need to download Cayenne 4.0, which is the latest stable release of the program. You can download various binary distributions of the program depending on your operating system here: http://cayenne.apache.org/download.html

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks such as Cayenne are useful because they eliminate the need to write SQL code (eliminating a common vulnerability vector in the process) for web applications. They also automatically take care of mapping database entities to Java objects (and vice versa) which makes working with databases easier for those who are not experienced with using them. 

You may also want to go through the tutorial for Cayenne first just to get acclimated to using the tool: https://cayenne.apache.org/docs/4.0/getting-started-guide/#learning-mapping-basics. This will help you understand some of the basics of using Cayenne, but there is some additional information that you will need when integrating Cayenne with Tapestry. You can skip steps (1.1, 1.2, 2.1 (Create a new Project in IntelliJ IDE), 3.1, and 4) as they do not pertain to using Cayenne with Tapestry or working in Eclipse. 

For this assignment you may either use a fresh Tapestry application (recommended as it will give you additional practice) or adapt your previous assignment (this is not quite as easy as you assume it to be). In either case, it will be necessary to have a Tapestry project to integrate with Cayenne.
